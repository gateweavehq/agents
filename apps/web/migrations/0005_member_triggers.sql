-- Custom SQL migration: what holds however a row comes to change.
--
-- The plugin counts a workspace's owners and then acts, in separate queries, and so does deleting an
-- account, so two owners leaving at the same moment could each see the other still there. A workspace
-- with no owner has nobody who can fix it, so the database refuses the change that would make one. A
-- workspace being deleted has gone by the time its members follow, and they are free to go.
--
-- Better Auth keeps several roles as a list, such as `owner,admin`, and that is an owner too, so the
-- word is looked for as a whole item of the list.
--
-- Whoever leaves a workspace is noted, because it keeps their conversations, and deleting their
-- account later has to reach it.
