# Contributing to Gateweave Agents

Thanks for helping out! This guide covers how to get a working setup and what we look for in a
pull request. Everyone taking part is expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Setup

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm doctor      # checks Node, pnpm and the local setup, with fixes for anything missing
pnpm dev:setup
pnpm dev
```

See the [README](README.md) for details and [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for how
the system fits together. Read [docs/spec.md](docs/spec.md) for what the product is meant to
become.

## Contributor License Agreement

Gateweave Agents is open source under the AGPL-3.0. The maintainer also offers it under other terms,
such as a hosted service and commercial licenses, and these help fund the project. So that every
contribution can be part of both, contributors sign the [CLA](CLA.md) once, and it covers every
Gateweave project. You keep the copyright to your work.

A bot asks you to sign on your first pull request. To sign, reply with the sentence it gives you.

## Before you open a pull request

```sh
pnpm verify      # Biome check, typecheck, tests and a production build: what CI runs
```

`pnpm format` fixes most Biome findings. While iterating, scope a command to one package, for
example `pnpm --filter @gateweave/agents-web test`.

Fill in the pull request template: it asks how you tested the change and whether it needs a
migration. You don't need to edit `CHANGELOG.md`; it is written when a
version is released.

## Guidelines

- **Keep changes focused.** One pull request should cover one concern. Open an issue first for
  large features or anything that changes the data model.
- **Test behavior, not implementation.** Worker tests build the app and run it in workerd
  (`apps/web/test`). Add a test for every bug fix.
- **Schema changes need migrations.** Edit the Drizzle schema, then run `pnpm db:generate` in the
  package that owns it. Commit the generated migration. Never edit a migration that has already
  been merged.
- **Match the surrounding code.** Biome enforces formatting. For everything else, follow the
  conventions of the file you are editing.

## Commit messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org): `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`,
`refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`. Add a scope when it helps, for example
`fix(web): keep the workspace menu open on mobile`.

## Working with AI coding agents

You are welcome to use one. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) gives agents the project's commands,
invariants and conventions, and `.claude/skills/` holds step-by-step playbooks for recurring
tasks such as changing a schema or opening a pull request. You remain responsible for the change:
review it, run `pnpm verify`, and make sure you can explain it in review.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue using the bug report form: the steps to reproduce, what you expected, and what
happened. Report security problems privately, as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), never
in a public issue.
