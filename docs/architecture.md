# Architecture

How Gateweave Agents is built today. [spec.md](spec.md) describes where it is going; this file
changes with the code.

## One Worker

The UI, the API and auth ship as one Worker (`apps/web`), the same shape as Gateweave Track:

- **TanStack Start** renders pages on the server and hydrates them in the browser. Server
  functions are the API: each one checks the session and, for workspace data, the caller's
  membership before doing anything.
- **Better Auth** owns accounts, sessions, workspaces (its organizations), members, roles and
  invitations, stored in **D1**. There is one Better Auth instance per isolate, built on first
  use, because workerd forbids I/O in global scope.
- **Rate limits** on sign-in, password reset, invitations and email are counted in a
  `RateLimiter` Durable Object per client address or recipient, so they hold across isolates and
  locations. Everything else is limited in memory per isolate.
- **Email** goes through Cloudflare Email Service when `EMAIL_FROM` is set: password reset,
  verification and invitations. Without it, invitations are links to share.

## The registry

Each workspace's registry is a Durable Object with its own SQLite database (`RegistryDO` in
`packages/registry`, named by the workspace id). Pages read it through server functions; it is
not synced to the browser yet (see "Decisions" in the spec).

- **Access.** The registry has no route. A server function checks the caller's session and D1
  membership (`currentMember`), then calls the workspace's registry over RPC. Deleting a
  workspace deletes its registry too.
- **Data.** Projects group repositories, and a repository can be in several. Repositories are
  matched by the provider's own id, so a rename keeps their history. A scan of one repository at
  one commit lists the agents configured in it (Claude Code, Codex, and so on, and their
  subagents) and the assets they read: instructions, prompts, skills, plugins, scripts, MCP
  servers and settings. `packages/model` defines that contract, and the registry validates
  every call against it.
- **Content.** Files are stored once, by Git blob id, in a `blobs` table; files over 256 KiB keep
  their id and size but not their text. An asset's hash covers its files' paths, relative to the
  asset, and their blob ids, so the same skill or `CLAUDE.md` has the same hash in every
  repository. That is how drift shows: compare hashes. An asset gets a new version only when its
  hash changes, and each version records the commit it was found at.
- **Scans replace.** Applying a scan makes the repository's agents and assets match it, in one
  transaction. What it no longer finds is marked removed rather than deleted, and comes back
  with the same id if a later scan finds it. A scan older than the last one applied is ignored,
  so webhooks that arrive out of order cannot roll a repository back. A failed scan is recorded
  without touching what earlier scans found.
- **Room for the runtime.** Agents and assets may have no repository: those are agents defined
  in the app and assets in the library (phases 2 and 3). Setups, teams and runs come as tables
  of their own when those phases start.

## What comes next

- A **GitHub App**. Installing it on an account or organization links that installation to a
  workspace in D1. Webhooks and scans read each repository's agent configuration with the
  narrowest permissions that allow it, and report it to the registry.
- **Format adapters**: small, pure modules that turn the files of one agent (Claude Code, Codex,
  Gemini CLI, Cursor) into a scan, each tested against real examples.

## Deploys

`main` deploys to staging after CI passes, and a published GitHub release deploys production
(`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). D1 migrations are applied before the new code goes live.
