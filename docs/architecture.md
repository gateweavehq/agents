# Architecture

How Gateweave Agents is built today. [spec.md](spec.md) describes where it is going; this file
changes with the code.

## One Worker

The UI, the API and auth ship as one Worker (`apps/web`), the same shape as Gateweave Track:

- **TanStack Start** renders pages on the server and hydrates them in the browser. Server
  functions are the API: each one checks the session and, for workspace data, the caller's
  membership before doing anything.
- **Better Auth** owns accounts, sessions, workspaces (its organizations), members, roles and
  invitations, stored in **D1**. There is one Better Auth instance per isolate, built on first
  use, because workerd forbids I/O in global scope.
- **Rate limits** on sign-in, password reset, invitations and email are counted in a
  `RateLimiter` Durable Object per client address or recipient, so they hold across isolates and
  locations. Everything else is limited in memory per isolate.
- **Email** goes through Cloudflare Email Service when `EMAIL_FROM` is set: password reset,
  verification and invitations. Without it, invitations are links to share.

## The registry

Each workspace's registry is a Durable Object with its own SQLite database (`RegistryDO` in
`packages/registry`, named by the workspace id). Pages read it through server functions; it is
not synced to the browser yet (see "Decisions" in the spec).

- **Access.** The registry has no route. A server function checks the caller's session and D1
  membership (`currentMember`), then calls the workspace's registry over RPC. Deleting a
  workspace deletes its registry too.
- **Data.** Projects group repositories, and a repository can be in several. Repositories are
  matched by the provider's own id, so a rename keeps their history. A scan of one repository at
  one commit lists the agents configured in it (Claude Code, Codex, and so on, and their
  subagents) and the assets they read: instructions, prompts, skills, plugins, scripts, MCP
  servers and settings. `packages/model` defines that contract, and the registry validates
  every call against it.
- **Content.** Files are stored once, by Git blob id, in a `blobs` table; files over 256 KiB keep
  their id and size but not their text. An asset's hash covers its files' paths, relative to the
  asset, and their blob ids, so the same skill or `CLAUDE.md` has the same hash in every
  repository. That is how drift shows: compare hashes. An asset gets a new version only when its
  hash changes, and each version records the commit it was found at.
- **Scans replace.** Applying a scan makes the repository's agents and assets match it, in one
  transaction. What it no longer finds is marked removed rather than deleted, and comes back
  with the same id if a later scan finds it. A scan older than the last one applied is ignored,
  so webhooks that arrive out of order cannot roll a repository back. A failed scan is recorded
  without touching what earlier scans found.
- **Room for the runtime.** Agents and assets may have no repository: those are agents defined
  in the app and assets in the library (phases 2 and 3). Setups, teams and runs come as tables
  of their own when those phases start.

## GitHub

A workspace reads its repositories through a GitHub App ([github-app.md](github-app.md) sets one
up). `packages/github` is the app's client: a JWT signed with WebCrypto, installation tokens
cached per isolate, the OAuth web flow with PKCE, and webhook signatures. It needs nothing but
`fetch` and `crypto.subtle`, so it runs in workerd without Node polyfills.

- **Linking.** A `github_installation` row in D1 links an installation to one workspace. An
  admin links it through install, setup and callback (`apps/web/src/server/github/flow.ts`).
  The installation id that GitHub's setup redirect carries is not trusted: the link is made only
  after a user token shows that this person can reach the installation on GitHub. The token is
  not kept.
- **Staying in step.** Linking, and webhooks for installation and repository changes, list the
  installation's repositories and reconcile them into the registry: new ones appear, renamed ones
  keep their history (they are matched by GitHub's id), and ones the app no longer reaches are
  marked removed. Uninstalling the app, or disconnecting it, removes them all. Webhooks are
  verified with the app's secret; deliveries for installations no workspace linked are
  acknowledged and dropped.

## Format adapters

`packages/adapters` turns a repository's files into the agents and assets of a scan. It is pure
TypeScript with no I/O, so it runs in the Worker. The scanner lists the repository's tree, asks
`wantsFile` which paths it needs, downloads those, and calls `detect`.

- **One adapter per coding agent** (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor), each knowing only its
  own files, so a repository with just `AGENTS.md` has a Codex agent and nothing else. The
  vendor's documentation is linked at the top of each adapter.
- **Shared files are shared assets.** `detect` merges what the adapters find by asset key, so
  `AGENTS.md` or a `.agents/skills` folder is one asset that several agents read.
- **Secrets stay in the adapters.** Settings and MCP configuration are stored as canonical JSON
  (or TOML) with every value under `env` or `headers`, and anything that looks like a credential,
  replaced by `<redacted>`. Metadata carries the names of variables and headers, never values.
- **A Claude Code plugin is its root folder**, the parent of `.claude-plugin/`, because its
  commands, agents, skills and hooks live beside the manifest and a change to them must change
  the asset. Files are given by blob and size; only `.claude-plugin/*.json`, `.mcp.json` and
  `hooks/hooks.json` keep their (redacted) text. Another plugin's folder is never part of a
  plugin, and a plugin at the repository root takes only the documented component locations (and
  the paths its manifest names), not the whole repository. A root plugin is keyed
  `.claude-plugin`, since a path cannot be empty.
- **Problems, not exceptions.** A file that is missing its text or does not parse becomes a
  `ScanProblem` and is skipped; the rest of the scan goes on.

## Scans

Each workspace's `RegistryDO` scans its own repositories. Requests wait in its SQLite database
(`scan_requests`), and its alarm works through them a few at a time.

- **What asks for a scan.** A push to a repository's default branch (the webhook), and a
  reconcile that finds a repository new, back after removal, on another default branch or never
  scanned. Asking again while a request waits moves it to the front.
- **What a scan reads.** The default branch's head and its whole tree, then the text of the
  files the adapters want (`wantsFile`), fifty blobs per GraphQL request. Texts the registry
  already holds, by blob id, are not downloaded again, so a scan after a push downloads what the
  push changed. A wanted symlink, such as `CLAUDE.md` pointing to `AGENTS.md`, is read as its
  target. A head the last successful scan already read is not scanned again, unless a member
  asks with "Scan now", which forces a read for after the adapters learn something new.
- **Writes stay synchronous.** A scan awaits GitHub outside any transaction, then validates the
  result like any other scan and applies it in one. A failure is recorded on the repository and
  tried again after a minute, ten minutes and an hour; what earlier scans found stays.

## Pages

The workspace's pages read the registry through server functions in `apps/web/src/lib/registry.ts`,
each of which checks membership first, so a non-member gets the same "not found" as a missing
workspace.

- **Overview** counts what the registry holds and shows a matrix of repositories by the coding
  agents each one configures.
- **Repositories** lists them with their scan status; a repository's page shows its agents, the
  assets they read grouped by kind, and the problems the last scan found.
- **Agents** lists every agent and subagent by runtime.
- **An asset's page** shows the text of each of its files, the agents that read it, how many
  other assets have the same content, and every earlier version.

Pages refresh themselves while a scan of what they show is waiting or running.

## What comes next

- **Projects**, grouping repositories, with their own pages.

## Deploys

`main` deploys to staging after CI passes, and a published GitHub release deploys production
(`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). D1 migrations are applied before the new code goes live.
